__Elm Workshop.__

A Pok√©mon mini-game.  
Using Elm `v0.19`.

```shell
# Class materials, starting kit
cd materials/

# The presentation for the class
cd presentation/

# The end result of what're building
cd result/
```

For those wondering what that `_` directory is about,
it's the game engine. In other words, all the code that
I wrote for you so you can easily put the game together.
Disclaimer: I haven't built many games before, so it
might not be the greatest code ever written.
